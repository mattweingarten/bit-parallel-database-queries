Some ideas:
- keep relevant links to papers etc in this file
- store each new round of optimizations in the "models" folder
- every model should mention if it optimized select or aggregate or join
- keep track of models and their stats (cycles and what have you) in a google sheet
- do report on overleaf but idk made a folder anyway in case
- collect all outside code in the "include" folder
- keep track of input sizes, cache line sizes etc should all be in some header file (haven't made it yet)
