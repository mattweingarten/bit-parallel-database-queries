What if 512 % (numsamples  * numfeatures) != 0?
Can we assume precision to be 32 bits (and 31 with < )
To what extent do we reconstruct the data ? (return bitvector of zeros and ones ) or not? -> how does this factor into performance


What happens when we mod by 0 ? C standard says this results in UB
