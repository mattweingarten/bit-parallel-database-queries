What if 512 % (numsamples  * numfeatures) != 0?
Can we assume precision to be 32 bits (and 31 with < )
To what extent do we reconstruct the data ? (return bitvector of zeros and ones ) or not? -> how does this factor into performance


What happens when we mod by 0 ? C standard says this results in UB


Modulo reduction teqnuiques:

x % y == z
special cases: 
    -> y = 0 -> false
    -> y = 2^n -> bitshift and & 
    -> y > x ==> x == z
